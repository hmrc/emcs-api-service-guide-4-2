<%= partial 'documentation/partials/google_tag_manager_js' %>
Learn how to use the [Excise Movement Control System (EMCS) API](https://developer.service.hmrc.gov.uk/api-documentation/docs/api/service/excise-movement-control-system-api/1.0) with your software.

## API overview

The EMCS API is based on REST principles.

The endpoints accept data in XML format, and return data in XML wrapped in JSON.

The API uses standard HTTP error response codes.

Use the EMCS API to:

* submit movement information to the Excise Movement and Control System (EMCS)
* retrieve information about movements

## API status

This version of the EMCS API:

- is in [the beta phase](https://www.gov.uk/service-manual/agile-delivery/how-the-beta-phase-works)
- is currently ready for testing
- is ready for use production

## Getting started

### Using EMCS API for the first time

If you are new to the EMCS API, you should follow these steps:

- Read all of this document before reviewing other documents for EMCS API
- Follow all of the steps in [Using the Developer Hub](#using-the-developer-hub).
- Read the [EMCS API 4.2 testing guide](/guides/emcs-api-testing-guide-4-2/)
- Read the [EMCS API 4.2 technical interface specification](/guides/excise-movement-control-system-api-tis-4-2/)
- Read [Making API requests](/#making-api-requests)

### Migrating from an earlier version

If you are migrating from the old SOAP EMCS API, you should read:

- the [migrating from SOAP API page](/documentation/migration-guide.html) before reviewing other documents for EMCS API
- the [EMCS API 4.2 testing guide](/guides/emcs-api-testing-guide-4-2/)
- the [EMCS API 4.2 technical interface specification](/guides/excise-movement-control-system-api-tis-4-2/)
- [Making API requests](/#making-api-requests)

### Using the Developer Hub

When you have completed the relevant steps above, you should follow these steps:

1. If you haven't already, [sign up for an HMRC developer account](https://developer.service.hmrc.gov.uk/developer/registration), activate it by email, and [sign in](https://developer.service.hmrc.gov.uk/developer/login)).
2. Learn about the [user-restricted authentication](https://developer.service.hmrc.gov.uk/api-documentation/docs/authorisation/user-restricted-endpoints) used by the API.
3. [Create an application](https://developer.service.hmrc.gov.uk/developer/applications/) in our sandbox environment.
4. Add your subscription to this API to your application software.
5. Use the [Create Test User API](https://developer.service.hmrc.gov.uk/api-documentation/docs/api/service/api-platform-test-user/1.0) to create one or more test users for your sandbox application. You should follow the [instructions in the testing guide for creating a test user](/guides/emcs-api-testing-guide-4-2/documentation/create-a-test-user.html).

Use the Developer Hub to:

- add your production application
- subscribe it to the APIs you want to integrate with
- apply for production credentials and agree to our terms of use

We'll check your application, which takes up to 10 working days.

### Making API requests

Before sending any requests to EMCS API, you should ensure that you are using the following in your software:

- the correct URL for the environment and API version number
- the correct header contents and payload information, contained in the [EMCS API reference](/api-documentation/docs/api/service/excise-movement-control-system-api/1.0/oas/page)
