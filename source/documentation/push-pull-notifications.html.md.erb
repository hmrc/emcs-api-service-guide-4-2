# Push pull notifications
<%= partial 'documentation/partials/google_tag_manager_js' %>
Our automated service can send you notifications about new messages from the EMCS. This functionality will send you a notification each time there is a new message for you to read.

This means that your:

- software will not have to poll for updated information
- requests are unlikely to be rate limited because they’ll not be as frequent
- network usage will also go down because you’ll not need to poll

Notification content:

- push notifications will not include the message but a field called messageUri
- this will contain the relative path to the full XML message
- use the messageUri to download the XML message from the EMCS API

For information on how to configure and test this functionality, read the [EMCS API testing guide](/guides/emcs-api-testing-guide-4-2/).
