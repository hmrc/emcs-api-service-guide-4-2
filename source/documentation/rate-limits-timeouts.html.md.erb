# Rate limits and timeouts
<%= partial 'documentation/partials/google_tag_manager_js' %>
We limit the number of requests each application can make. This protects our service against excessive use and Denial-of-Service attacks, and also encourages you to use our APIs efficiently.

We set limits based on anticipated loads and peaks. Our standard limit is 3 requests per second per application.

If you reach this limit you’ll get a response with an HTTP status of ```429``` (Too Many Requests). If a 429 response is received we recommend that your code should stop making additional API requests for a short period of time before retrying.

You can read more about rate limiting on the [developer hub](https://developer.service.hmrc.gov.uk/api-documentation/docs/reference-guide#rate-limiting)
