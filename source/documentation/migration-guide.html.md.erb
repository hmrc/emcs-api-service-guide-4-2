# Migrating from SOAP API

If you have previously used the EMCS SOAP API, you may find the following information useful.

## Differences

The endpoints accept data in XML format, and now return data in XML wrapped in JSON.

The XML for the IE messages remains the same as the SOAP API. The SOAP API wrapped the XML in a SOAP envelope, but this will no longer be needed in the RESTful API.

You can find the [request schema on GitHub](https://github.com/hmrc/excise-movement-control-system-api/tree/main/app/xsd).

There is no longer an individual endpoint for every message you need to send. Many different messages can now be sent to a single endpoint, ['Submit a message for an excise movement'](/guides/emcs-api-service-guide-4-2/documentation/submit-message.html).

## Equivalent SOAP API endpoints

There some changes to the API endpoints in the new RESTful API. You can find the new endpoints and their previous SOAP API equivalents below.
