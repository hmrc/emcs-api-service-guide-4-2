# Get excise movements
<%= partial 'documentation/partials/google_tag_manager_js' %>
This endpoint allows you to retrieve information about all movements for an excise reference number (ERN), or for all ERNs in your bearer token.

Use the GET endpoint [Get excise movements](/api-documentation/docs/api/service/excise-movement-control-system-api/1.0/oas/page#tag/Movements/operation/getAllMovements) to retrieve the status of an existing excise movement.

## Requirements 

You will only be able to retrieve movements where the consignor ID or consignee ID of the movement matches any of your excise reference numbers (ERNs) in the bearer token that you use for API authentication.

## Query parameters

Query parameters must be entered as listed below. They are all optional.

| Parameter | Type | Details |
| -- | -- | -- |
| ern          | String                        | Filter excise movements by excise reference number (consignor ID/consignee ID). If you do not provide an excise reference number (ERN) as a query parameter, you will get a list for all ERNs in your bearer token. |
| arc          | String                        | Filter excise movements by administrative reference code (ARC)|
| lrn          | String                        | Filter excise movements by local reference number (LRN)|
| updatedSince | String <date-time> (DateTime) | Filter excise movements modified after provided timestamp. This can be used to poll for any updated movements.<br></br><br></br> You may want to consider using the latest `lastUpdated` as the value to pass to `updatedSince`, the next time you poll as an optimisation.<br></br><br></br> For each updated movement that is returned, you can then call the [Get all messages endpoint](get-all-messages.html) and pass in the same value for its "updatedSince" query parameter to get the messages that have been received since you last polled.|
| traderType   | String ("consignor" or "consignee") | Filter excise movements for a trader type. This will filter movements for a `consignor` or `consignee` by matching any of the ERNs in the bearer token with the `consignor` or `consignee` of the movement respectively.
